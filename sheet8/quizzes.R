# Quizzes from lecture

# Question 1
# Answer: d)
# a, b, c: p is a fixed value, not a chance or interval

# Question 2
# Answer: a) and c) (+1)

# Question 3
# Answer: c)
# a: mean, not median
# b: t-test needs normal distribution (one mode!)
# c: high P-value -> fail to reject null hypothesis, but never accept it
# e: exact is "should P-value be exact or not?", distribution of test
#     statistic ist based on Central Limit Theorem (based on data), i.e.
#     different things :)

# Answer: b) (neither linear, nor monotonic correlation) and
#         c) (x down -> y up)
# Pearson: linear correlation
# Spearman: monotonic correlations based in ranking
# d: no linear or monotonic realationship, but other correlation still
#     possible (see plot, y = x^4)
